> Note: If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, you can run a "docker shell" with make dshell from which you'll have a fully working Node.js environment. Make sure you have already installed both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- Install dependencies: `make install`
- Run in dev mode: `make start`
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Clean: `make clean`
